# 🏃💨 SCRIPT RUNNER 🏃💨
## What is it? 
Script runner's job is to run all of the scripts for the upcoming version when the server starts.

## How To Use It
Write a script using the [Guidelines](). <sup>WIP</sup>  
Upload your script to the upcoming scripts folder - currently 'index' ( managed by common/SCRIPTS_DIRECTORY).  
**notice**: the script has to be a `.sql` file in order for the reader to read it  
Once the sprint is complete - move all of the scripts to the appropriate archive folder (instead of DB scripts!)
